# Data_Analysis_TotalFertilityRate
 
This is a data analysis of South Korea's Total Fertility Rate (TFR) done using Jupyter Notebook.

By importing several python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Scikit-learn), I have done:
1. Visualized related datasets
2. Found correlation between variables
3. Predicted future TFR.

## 1. South Korea's Population Pyramid

### 2008 Population Pyramid


### 2021 Population Pyramid


I have noticed that the number of youth population had decreased while the numbers of the working-age population and elderly population had increased. 
This indicates that the pace of population aging is fast, and it presents the possibility of an aging society. 
One possible factor could be the increase in life expectancy caused by technological improvements.

To further investigate on this phenomenon, I took a look into the number of birth and total fertility rate.

## 2. South Korea's Number of Birth and Total Fertility Rate (TFR)


As illustrated in the chart, a negative trend is found. Both the number of birth and total fertility rate have decreased. 

I have considered different possible factors that might have affected such rates.

## 3. Crude Birth Rate


By looking at the graph, I noticed that people tend to not get married as time passes by. Even though they do get married, married couples decide not to bear children as shown in TFR illustartion. I was curious what might have affected such results.

## 4. Private Education Expense


## 5. Consumer Price Index
