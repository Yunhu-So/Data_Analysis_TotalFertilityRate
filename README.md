# Data_Analysis_TotalFertilityRate
 
This is a data analysis of South Korea's Total Fertility Rate (TFR) done using Jupyter Notebook.

By importing several python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Scikit-learn), I have done:
1. Visualized related datasets
2. Found correlation between variables
3. Predicted future TFR.

## 1. South Korea's Population Pyramid

### 2008 Population Pyramid vs 2021 Population Pyramid

I have noticed that the number of youth population had decreased while the numbers of the working-age population and elderly population had increased. 
This indicates that the pace of population aging is fast, and it presents the possibility of an aging society. 
One possible factor could be the increase in life expectancy caused by technological improvements.

To further investigate on this phenomenon, I took a look into the number of birth and total fertility rate.

## 2. South Korea's Number of Birth and Total Fertility Rate (TFR)

As illustrated in the chart, a negative trend is found. Both the number of birth and total fertility rate have decreased. 

I have considered different possible factors that might have affected such rates.

## 3. Crude Marriage Rate

By looking at the graph, I noticed that people tend to not get married as time passes by. Even though they do get married, married couples decide not to bear children as shown in TFR illustartion. I was curious what might have affected such results.

## 4. Private Education Expense

Private education expense has been in positive trend except for 2020. I assume this happened due to the break out of Covid-19, which has created social distancing and preventive measures. Yet, the rate has reached its peak in 2021 when the government implemented 'living with Covid-19' plan.
Meanwhile, I was curious if this was the only factor that burden couples to bear no children in their marriage.

## 5. Consumer Price Index

As obsereved in the graph, prices constantly increases. By considering correlation between Per Capita Income and inflation, individuals struggle in living their own lives, which make them not to have children.

## Conclusion

To solve the issue of aging society, we need to consider several fundamental factors, not only TFR or number of birth. 

Correlation
